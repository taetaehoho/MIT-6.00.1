MIT 6.0001

After completing CS50 6/20/2021 I decided to start MIT 6.001 as part of OSSU (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) on 6/21/2021. Hope to be able to finish a good chunk of core theory, core programming before the summer ends. 

This is the first few steps in my two year journey so stay tuned! I'll be posting updates on my blog so check it out.
