MIT 6.00.1

After completing CS50 6/20/2021 I decided to start MIT 6.001 as part of OSSU (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Hope to be able to finish a good chunk of core theory before the summer ends. 

This is part of my two year plan to build technical fluency so keep track of my progress here!
