Plays the game of scrabble/word with friends. 

Rules: 
  1. Asks how many hands you want to play. 
  2. Allows one substitution of a letter at the start of each round. Allows you to replay one hand and take the higher score of the replay once per game. 
  3. Asks for valid word you can construct with letters you have in the hand. 
  4. Outputs final score. 
  
Definitely took a while but getting much more familiar with python and problem solving!
